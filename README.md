# virtual-memory-sim

This is a command line program designed and engineered by David Mash that simulates a virtual memory page table using the second chance scheduling algorithm.
This project is meant to demonstrate my ability to write complex algorithms, while sustaining a clear coding style.

In order to test the program, run vmsim on the commandline with one of the given tracefiles and arguments for the number of frames, the page size, and the memory split to use.
